<h3 align="center">Sniper - the tool to execute Salesforce apex code in series</h3>

 Think about it as an extension of the Dataloader. </br>
 The Dataloader simply uploads series of records whereas Sniper executes given apex code for series of records. </br>
 Examples? Locking a pack of opportunities, merging long list of contacts, executing assignment process, performing not trivial data fixes that require apex. </br>
 It as as easy as it looks and help save lots of time. Enjoy it!</br>
