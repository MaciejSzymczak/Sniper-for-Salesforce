<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sniper</h1>
<h3 align="center">Sniper - the tool to execute Salesforce apex code in series</h3>
Think about it as an extension of the Dataloader. </br>
The Dataloader simply uploads series of records whereas Sniper executes given apex code for series of records. </br>
Examples? Locking a pack of opportunities, merging long list of contacts, executing assignment process, performing not trivial data fixes that require apex. </br>
It as as easy as it looks and help save lots of time. Enjoy it!</br>
</br>
Here is fine example what you can do with Sniper:</br> 
<table style="border: 1px solid black;"><tr><td>
Approval.lock('0064J000005Qk7cQAC');</br> 
Approval.lock('0064J000005Qk7dQAC');</br> 
Approval.lock('0064J000005Qk7eQAC');</br> 
Approval.lock('0064J000005Qk7fQAC');</br> 
Approval.lock('0064J000005Qk7gQAC');</br> 
</td></tr></table>
